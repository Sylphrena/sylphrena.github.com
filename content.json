Foremost, teaching itself. Regardless of the fact that we have been taught as students for at least 10 years, very few of us actually touch the art of teaching. Therefore, although we have prepared teaching contents - seasons and climate - before project week, it is not hard to explain that upon the first day of the teaching most of us encountered miscellaneous difficulties including: overestimation of students’ English levels, inability to encourage students to participate in class activities and lack of adaptability of teaching contents to different levels of students in terms of English proficiency. In my first class, I tried to teach Grade 9 students in complete English lecture but failed entirely, because I designed my class on the assumption that their English degree was approximately the same as mine back in my 9th Grade. However, it turned out that this was totally wrong. The students in Xishui Siyuan came from different villages and counties around the school, but I came from Suzhou, an economically and educationally developed metropolis. Learning from this failure, I quickly changed my whole English lecture to both Chinese and English one, which turned out to be quite an effective way there. One approach to preclude this problem is to contact their English teachers to know their real English levels prior to the preparation of teaching. Other problems were mainly concerned with our teaching ability, which we could only enquire through numerous teaching experiences including this trip. For example, we have additionally prepared “Emotions” and “Tic Tac Toe” as warm-up activities and reduced the difficulties of “Seasons and climate” for lower grades. And in order to involve students into the class, we have bought snacks and candies. So, I would rather view the teaching part of this trip as a precious pre-exposure to the required capabilities and responsibilities of being a teacher. Beyond the teaching experience it self, the trip in Xishui Siyuan School is rather a culture exchange. We were able to peer into the true situation of Chinese education. The reason I used the phrase “peer into” is that the situation displayed to us was distorted: we were never allowed to audit part of the lesson their teachers taught and the classes we taught were selected as the best ones. But it was still valuable because the education there varied way too much from ours to be neglected. When we gave instructions to the students in English, none of the students knew what to do. But when we used Chinese instead, everybody answered correctly. This situation reflected an astounding fact: even in the highest grade of middle school, 9th Grade, in which the students were expected to have a considerable level of English proficiency to be able to chat with friends in simple English, the students were still taught in their mother tongue, Chinese. If we dug deeper and researched more, we could easily approach the conclusion that their educational system was mainly served as a tool to pass tests and to distinguish students, rather than to help students acquire knowledge and foster ability. It is true that these two sets - passing tests and learning knowledge - have some overlapping parts, but their purposes vary profoundly. With the increasing speed of globalization of not only economics but also cultures, Chinese educational system is gradually recognized, acknowledged and learned by the whole world due to its great achievement in cultivating talents and its indispensable role in Chinese soaring development. However, after learning from this trip, we need to be cautious of it because its goal deviate the mission of education itself despite its achievement. For the kids there, this culture exchange was mainly a chance to get to know world’s cultures and nations. Very few of them have stepped out of their own province, not to say China. Almost none of them have seen foreigners in their lives before. Therefore, this experience was an excellent opportunity for them to broaden their horizons. Our group indeed achieved that by making our lectures focus more on the diversities of seasons and climates around the world. For other groups, they talked about music around the world, religions around the world and even clothes around the world. At the end of the teaching trip, we could confidently say that they indeed got to know a lot about the world they lived in. In the second and third part of the whole project week, climbing Dabie Mountain and visiting city Wuhan, we visited the amazing natural and humanistic scenes in Hubei province. I would like to say I was more attracted by mother nature’s uncanny craftsmanship than by an unexpected anachronism - the great ancient Huanghe tower standing in the center of a modernized city Wuhan. The evanescent weather turning snow and frog into sunshine in a blink of an eye, the precipitous cliffs soaring into the sky by almost 90 degrees and the omnipresent waterfalls haunting my ears like a melodious symphony, all of them contributed to the everlasting beauty of Dabie Mountain. I took tons of photos of beautiful sceneries during the trip and given the chance, I would like to taste again the charm of Dabie Mountain. Whenever I grew tired of my tedious study or mundane life in the future, I would always be reminded of that place, giving me inspirations and encouragements to carry on.","categories":[{"name":"Academia - UWC","slug":"Academia-UWC","permalink":"http://sylphrena.github.io/categories/Academia-UWC/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Reflection","slug":"Reflection","permalink":"http://sylphrena.github.io/tags/Reflection/"},{"name":"English","slug":"English","permalink":"http://sylphrena.github.io/tags/English/"},{"name":"Project week","slug":"Project-week","permalink":"http://sylphrena.github.io/tags/Project-week/"}],"keywords":[{"name":"Academia - UWC","slug":"Academia-UWC","permalink":"http://sylphrena.github.io/categories/Academia-UWC/"}]},{"title":"New\\_Game\\_One","slug":"New-Game-One","date":"2016-11-11T00:20:11.000Z","updated":"2016-12-21T01:37:34.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/11/11/New-Game-One/","link":"","permalink":"http://sylphrena.github.io/2016/11/11/New-Game-One/","excerpt":"","text":"Friendly fire: 50% Duelist: Peter Tilker Crafts: [Movement]{4}\\0\\ Dash to a square(1*1) maximum 10 mats away, inflicting 50 damage on the square.

This is where our schools’ missions align, all of us uniting, no matter what background we come from to create a better future for ourselves and the generations to come.我们都来自不同的国家和背景，但我们仍然团结在一起，共同为一个美好的未来而奋斗，这正是我们希望在这几天的交流活动中传达给各位的 UWC 的独特文化。 When I first arrived in China, over two months ago, I realized that lots of my prior expectations and assumptions were wrong. Even today, there is still lots more for me to learn about China and for many of us to learn about Hubei. This is an opportunity for us to get over those stereotypes that we have and learn about the different backgrounds that we come from, celebrating and learning from our differences.时光荏苒，当我两个月前首次抵达中国的时候，我认识到我对于中国的许多固有印象和偏见都是错误的。甚至到现在，中国仍然有很多值得我学习的地方，湖北对于我们来说也是如此。这对于我们和各位来说正是一次消除偏见，拥抱差异，学习不同的宝贵的机会。 Our schedule is loaded with different opportunities for us to learn about each other through classes, competitions, fun sports and lastly the farewell performance to showcase a variety of cultures and backgrounds from all over the world.

Looking back on the past three months, I could say that I have been transformed into a formal debate who can step into the contest field with full confidence of victory. We have learned numerous debating skills in our activity time. We have been trained on the etiquette on debating, such as dress code, gestures, body movement and facial expressions, responsibilities of 4 distinctive debating positions, such as argument, disputation, inquiry and summarization and gists of making a point consecutively. We also got a chance to fully train these skills through 3 times of model debates. What’s more, we build confidence. Skills are crucial, but more crucial is the confidence. If a debater does not possess the faith that he/she will claim victory, he/she will not. I gradually attained this pivotal capability through millions of thinking processes and small discussions on the topic of the debate before the contest actually took place. On the stage, it was just a matter of showing my best thinking I prepared.

However, because I paused my training in high school due to the heavy study load, my skill soon grew rusty. After I have spent 1h per week in my Badminton ZhiXing since this term, my dexterity, skill and consciousness has been greatly enhanced. For example, now every time I strike, I will look for chances to shoot at the four corners of the court so that it will become harder for my opponent to retrieve. More importantly, I find my biggest weakness: overstriding. Therefore, if my opponent first hit a drop shot and then clear, I may not be able to get it, because my body is too inclined to the net. Fortunately, I have been improving my steps by lowering my body weight, so that I can quickly return to my previous state. I have also learned how to drive near the net and at the back. It is a useful technique used in doubles against net play. It’s especially hard for right-handed net player to get the shuttle driven to the left side allay and vice versa. When driving to the back court, it is also difficult for right-handed backcourt player to get shuttle driven to the left back alley, and vice versa.","categories":[{"name":"Pursuitia - Badminton","slug":"Pursuitia-Badminton","permalink":"http://sylphrena.github.io/categories/Pursuitia-Badminton/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Badminton","slug":"Badminton","permalink":"http://sylphrena.github.io/tags/Badminton/"},{"name":"Reflection","slug":"Reflection","permalink":"http://sylphrena.github.io/tags/Reflection/"},{"name":"English","slug":"English","permalink":"http://sylphrena.github.io/tags/English/"}],"keywords":[{"name":"Pursuitia - Badminton","slug":"Pursuitia-Badminton","permalink":"http://sylphrena.github.io/categories/Pursuitia-Badminton/"}]},{"title":"First FOA Reflection","slug":"First FOA Reflection","date":"2016-11-04T13:05:29.000Z","updated":"2016-12-21T01:37:47.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/11/04/First FOA Reflection/","link":"","permalink":"http://sylphrena.github.io/2016/11/04/First FOA Reflection/","excerpt":"","text":"In my first Further Oral Activity (FOA), I intended to show how language is used in Apple’s “Think Different” brand recognition campaign in 1997 to persuade, to inform people and to spread their ideology — people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do — and why Apple wanted to promote its belief. Specifically, I focused on the use of historical figures and Apple’s core values in the famous one minute television commercial “Here’s to the crazy ones”. Through the analysis of 17 iconic personalities appeared and language techniques used, I revealed how the target audience might be touched by this ad to believe that people who think differently will change the world, including themselves and Apple. For instance, by using the way to decipher texts learned in class to explore the use of parallelism in the script, I suggested the reason why the ad stated 1You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them before it declared that 1About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them is that it wished to emphasize the only action which we can’t do — ignore them. This parallelism, together with other language skills, guided the audience to ponder upon their views on those crazy ones. Therefore, the ad successfully achieved its goal: communicate Apple’s core value to the audience. In order to dig deeper into the rationale Apple used its belief in this commercial campaign, I also introduced a theory called golden circle, Jobs’ own words on his definition of marketing in the confidential meeting, and the social context behind the ad. After finishing this activity, considering the feedback from my teacher and classmates, I do think that my FOA clearly achieved its purpose.","categories":[{"name":"Academia - UWC","slug":"Academia-UWC","permalink":"http://sylphrena.github.io/categories/Academia-UWC/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Reflection","slug":"Reflection","permalink":"http://sylphrena.github.io/tags/Reflection/"},{"name":"English","slug":"English","permalink":"http://sylphrena.github.io/tags/English/"},{"name":"FOA","slug":"FOA","permalink":"http://sylphrena.github.io/tags/FOA/"}],"keywords":[{"name":"Academia - UWC","slug":"Academia-UWC","permalink":"http://sylphrena.github.io/categories/Academia-UWC/"}]},{"title":"Hello World","slug":"hello-world","date":"2016-11-02T13:30:53.000Z","updated":"2016-11-02T13:30:53.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/11/02/hello-world/","link":"","permalink":"http://sylphrena.github.io/2016/11/02/hello-world/","excerpt":"","text":"Welcome to Hexo!
